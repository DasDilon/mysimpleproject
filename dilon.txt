How to Push?

1. Add
    git add <file-name> 
    (git add b.txt)
    or, if we want to include all the files,
    use:
    git add.
2. Commit Your Code.
git commit -m/-am "Message"

lets say we have multiple files:
a.txt, b.txt, c.txt,

When you want to commit all the files use
-am, wherein a means all;

when you do not want to commit all the 
files, we use 'm'
